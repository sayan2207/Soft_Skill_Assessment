### Here are the steps to solve a slide picture puzzle:

1. Analyze the puzzle: Look at the puzzle and take note of the image that you are trying to recreate. Identify any unique features that will help you put the puzzle together.

2. Move the pieces: Slide the pieces around the board by clicking on them and moving them to an empty space. You can move pieces horizontally or vertically, but you cannot lift them off the board.

3. Start with the edges: Begin by assembling the edge pieces. Identify the pieces that belong on the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the puzzle, and move them into position.

4. Work on the middle pieces: After assembling the edges, work on the middle pieces. Look for patterns or features that will help you match the pieces together.

5. Focus on small sections: Focus on small sections of the puzzle at a time. Group pieces together that have similar colors or patterns, and work on putting them together before moving on to the next section.

6. Be patient: Slide puzzles can be tricky, and it may take some time to figure out the right moves to solve the puzzle. Take breaks if you feel stuck or frustrated, and come back to the puzzle with fresh eyes.

7. Check your progress: Once you have assembled the puzzle, double-check your work to make sure that all of the pieces are in the correct position.
